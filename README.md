# Mineral.js
Running the Script language on a JavaScript interpreter

I worked on this project for [forax](https://github.com/forax/)'s Virtual
Machines class.

## Setup
```
npm install
```

## Running tests
```
grunt
```

## Running a script
```
./mineral.js <file>
```

## The name
It is named after [Atheist's song by the same name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0mq1_OAekA).
If you've never heard Jazzy Death Metal, now it's the time. :)
